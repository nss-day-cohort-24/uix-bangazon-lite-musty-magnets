## Bangazon Lite

Bangazon Lite is your one stop shop for buying and selling homemade products! Musty-Magnets offers a web based platform for both buyers and sellers to conduct their business with a streamlined user interface provided by React JS.

## Getting started

Want to contribute to the amazing experience that is Bangazon Lite? Great! 

Just follow these steps to get started!
    1. Open your terminal and create, then `cd` into a new local repository that will hold the files of your Bangazon Lite project.
    2. Run `git clone https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-24/uix-bangazon-lite-musty-magnets.git`
    3. Once complete you need to navigate into the correct folder to begin development.  This should do the trick:
    `cd uix-bangazon-lite-musty-magnets/bangazon` 
    4. Now we need to verify that all files were cloned into your repository by running `ls -a`.

#### Cloned Project Files
This is a list of files that clone with the current version of Bangazon Lite:
DONOTREADME.md
package.json
db.json
styleguide.config.js

You should also see folders for `src` and `public`.  We'll dive into file structure later. For now, lets move on to installing the core dependencies for Bangazon.

## Installing

Bangazon is built upon the React JS framework to offer users an intuitive interface and experience. This means we need to install React, along with some of its dependencies before development can start. Learn more about [React](reactjs.org).
