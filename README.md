# Bangazon Lite - an app for buying and selling homemade products 

## Project Specifics
The users for this application are crafty entrepreneurs looking to sell products and for hard-liner buyers who are against mass retail. It's all about making it special. 

Both types of users will need to register. Consider the information needed from each. (price, shipping info, email, phone, etc). Sellers will need to add products and quanties available. Buyers should be able to add things to a cart and go through a checkout process. Consider sellers can also be buyers.

Within each team, there will be sub-teams working on specific components. All components will come together to create the full app. As a team, review the github tickets and determine what you will tackle and accomplish. Starting out, the sub-teams will consist of project mangagement, design, and db/connections. Moving along, members will transition into the sign-up, buy/sell (show products), and purchase groups. Each sub-group will have one project manager. Project managers are the only ones that can approve merges.

## 

You must interview at least two people and come up with personas and a challenge statement for the application you are building. What challenge will this app solve for both of your users? (It will be a two-part challenge statement to cover buyers and sellers)

Your group will need to decide on a style guide for this application. Make sure you sketch and prototype your app as part of your planning process. The design of the final interface is up to your group.

Your team will decide on the data needed and how it is organized.

* Interviews, personas, and challenge statement
